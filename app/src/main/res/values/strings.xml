    <string name="main_credits">Nmap Wrapper for Android\nCreated by Werebug (https://werebug.com)\n\nThis is an Android wrapper around the official Nmap binary cross-compiled for Android.\n\nNote: This application does not support rooted phones at the moment, therefore all Nmap features that need root rights will not work.\n\nSource code, cross-compilation instructions and configuration are available at https://github.com/ruvolof/anmap-wrapper. Feel free to contribute or report bugs on Github.</string>
